description: Faith is a multifaceted design agency that creates bespoke typography,
  identity, motion and print works within the fashion, art and music spectrum. With
  a wealth of history spanning over three decades of graphic expression, Faith was
  initially founded as a chrysalis of design experimentation and discovery through
  the eyes of artist and typographer, Paul Sych. Faith has cultivated the visual vocabulary
  of multiple companies—producing prolific works in both digital and print spectrums
  that range from branding to motion design. To do this, we conceptualize and collaborate
  both internally and externally—purifying and diversifying the creative process alongside
  photographers, writers, producers, and the influence of a collective skillset. Our
  work has appeared in numerous books and publications worldwide and has been celebrated
  with many international design awards.
