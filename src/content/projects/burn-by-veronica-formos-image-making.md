key: burn
description: Blanketed by the heat of magnetic colour, human expression is torn apart
  in a vivid display of turbulence and aggression. Frenetic distortion strikes an
  unusual balance between beauty and struggle, calling forward a provocative glimpse
  into the spectre of media and culture. Veronica Formos represents her feelings and
  observations about our not so perfect and challenging world.
