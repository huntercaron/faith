key: futurezona
description: 'In aligning his manufacturing expertise with his boundless passion for
  futuristic art and cultural exploration, Futurezona became the offspring of artist
  and designer Ranbir Sidhu. Ranbir creates museum grade sculptures and furniture
  for clients such as Drake and Jay-Z that mesh modern-day engineering and futurism.
  The designs that Sidhu creates tend towards a functionality that we’ve always been
  immersed in — on our planet and in the stars. On the galactic influences in his
  work, he cites a table layered with 24 karat gold flake that resembles the distant
  familiarity of the cosmos. '
