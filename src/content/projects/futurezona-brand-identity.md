description: In aligning his manufacturing expertise with his boundless passion for
  futuristic art and cultural exploration, Futurezona became the offspring of artist
  and designer Ranbir Sidhu. Ranbir creates museum grade sculptures and furniture
  for the biggest names in fashion and hip hop for clients such as Drake and Jay-Z.
  Conceptually, Ranbir meshes a history of Sikhism, modern-day engineering and futurism
  to imagine and then create functioning art.
