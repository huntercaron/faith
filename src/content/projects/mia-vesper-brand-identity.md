description: Upcycling, the practice of turning used fabrics into new high fashion
  garments, is currently captivating the fashion world. In New York, there’s a new
  brand taking up the eco-mantle, Mia Vesper. Mia’s collection was born for her own
  want for lavish outerwear and is aiming to grow into new products such as shoes
  and basketball shorts. In 2020, Mia’s custom gown and headpiece was featured in
  Beyoncé’s visual album “Black Is King”.
