description: Known as the Canadian counterpart to Greenwich Village and Haight-Ashbury,
  Yorkville Village’s ad campaign “Style Revolution” pays homage to the robust art,
  fashion, music and experimental art community that flourished in the 1960s in Toronto.
  This art and fashion campaign was initiated and created as a throwback to the historical
  and cultural importance of the village. Today, Yorkville Village is the third most
  expensive retail space in North America.
